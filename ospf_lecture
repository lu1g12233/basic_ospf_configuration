OSPF - Open Shortest Path First, is a dynamic routing protocol widely used on the internet. 
It is designed for TCP/IP internet environments and an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP). 
It is also based on link-state or SPF technology. 

Features of OSPF
-support authentication
-utilizes IP multicast
-responds quickly to topology changes
-supports heirarchical routing
-allows route summarization
-support equal-cost multi-path

OSPFv2 - designed for routing IPv4 networks. 
-RFC2328
-Supports simple authentication and MD5 authentication
-Supports IPv4 only
-Runs on IPv4 transport
-Uses 7 types of LSAs

LSA Types for OSPFv2
1 - Router LSA
2 - Network LSA
3 - Network summary LSAs
4 - ASBR Summary LSA
5 - AS-External LSA
6 - Grouping Membership LSA
7 - NSSA External LSA

OSPFv3 - initially routing IPv6 but can now be used for IPv4 routing of networks. 
-RFC5340 - runs on IPv6 transport
-Initially supports IPv6 but can now support routing for IPv4 and IPv6 in RFC5838
-No built-in authetication and uses IPSec for authentication
-Uses 9 Types of LSAs

LSA Types for OSPFv3
0x2001 - Router LSA
0x2002 - Network LSA
0x2003 - Intra-Area Prefix LSA
0x2004 - Inter-Area Router LSA
0x2005 - AS-External LSA
0x2006 - Group Membership LSA
0x2007 - Type-7 LSA
0x2008 - Link LSA
0x2009 - Intra-area Prefix LSA


How OSPF Works
1. Exhange Topology information with other neighbors as Link State Advertisements (LSAs).
2. Creates topology map for the network know as Link State DAtabase (LSDB)
3. Calculate and find out the best paths.


OSPF Network Types - OSPF routing domain can be made up of various typees of network links.
Different network Types have been introduced for optimizing OSPF's performance based on the physical media of each OSPF interface.

Broadcast 
- Ethernet
-netowrk that supports multiple devices and broadcast or multicast packets sent by one device in the network can be received byt all or some of the other devices.
-automatically discover ospf neighbors
-default Hello interval is 10s default DeadInterval is 40s
-Elects Designated Router and Backup Designated Router

DR and BDR Function
- to reduce the number of adjacencies 
- to reduce the amount of routing protocol traffic and the size of the LSDB. 
- without DR and BDR all routers will need to have adjacency with each other (full mesh). 
- with DR and BDR all routers will form adjacency direct to DR and BDR only which serves as the central point for exchanging OSPF routing information between routers on the same segment.

DR Election
-highest priority value
-highest router id if there is a tie on the Priority value
 
BDR Election
- the second highest Priority
- the second highest router ID if there is a tie on a Priority.

DROTHER
- routers that are part of the ospf but did not win the DR/BDR Election
- manually setting the priority value of a router to 0 will automatically not participate in the election and becomes DROTHER

Default Priority value per Vendor
Cisco IOS - 1
Juniper - 128
Mikrotik - 1 
Huawei - 1


Point-to-point 
-HDLC
-PPP


Non-Broadcast Multi-Access
-Asynchronus Transfer Mode (ATM)
-Frame Relay
-X.25

Point-to-Multipoint
- No network is point-to-multipoint by default. 
- network can be manually configured to become a point-to-multipoint.
