OSPF - Open Shortest Path First, is a dynamic routing protocol widely used on the internet. 
It is designed for TCP/IP internet environments and an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP). 
It is also based on link-state or SPF technology. 

Features of OSPF
-support authentication
-utilizes IP multicast
-responds quickly to topology changes
-supports heirarchical routing
-allows route summarization
-support equal-cost multi-path

OSPFv2 - designed for routing IPv4 networks. 
-RFC2328
-Supports simple authentication and MD5 authentication
-Supports IPv4 only
-Runs on IPv4 transport
-Uses 7 types of LSAs

LSA Types for OSPFv2
1 - Router LSA
2 - Network LSA
3 - Network summary LSAs
4 - ASBR Summary LSA
5 - AS-External LSA
6 - Grouping Membership LSA
7 - NSSA External LSA

OSPFv3 - initially routing IPv6 but can now be used for IPv4 routing of networks. 
-RFC5340 - runs on IPv6 transport
-Initially supports IPv6 but can now support routing for IPv4 and IPv6 in RFC5838
-No built-in authetication and uses IPSec for authentication
-Uses 9 Types of LSAs

LSA Types for OSPFv3
0x2001 - Router LSA
0x2002 - Network LSA
0x2003 - Intra-Area Prefix LSA
0x2004 - Inter-Area Router LSA
0x2005 - AS-External LSA
0x2006 - Group Membership LSA
0x2007 - Type-7 LSA
0x2008 - Link LSA
0x2009 - Intra-area Prefix LSA


How OSPF Works
1. Exhange Topology information with other neighbors as Link State Advertisements (LSAs).
2. Creates topology map for the network know as Link State DAtabase (LSDB)
3. Calculate and find out the best paths.
